# Piano App Documentation

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the features and usage of the Simple Piano App built using JavaScript.

## Features

- **Virtual Piano Keys**: The app includes a set of virtual piano keys representing different musical notes.

- **Keyboard Interaction**: Users can play the piano using their computer keyboard.

- **Mouse Click Interaction**: Alternatively, users can click on the virtual piano keys using the mouse.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser
- Internet connection (for initial script loading)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/piano-app.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Start playing the piano by using your computer keyboard or mouse.

## Usage

### Keyboard Interaction

- Press the corresponding keys on your computer keyboard to play the piano notes.
- Use the following mapping for the keys:

  ```
  Q W E R T Y U I O P
  ```

  - Pressing 'Q' plays the first key, 'W' plays the second key, and so on.

### Mouse Click Interaction

- Click on the virtual piano keys using your mouse to produce sound.

## Example Code

Here's a simplified example of the JavaScript code responsible for handling piano interactions:

```javascript
// JavaScript code for piano app
document.addEventListener('keydown', playNote);

function playNote(event) {
  const keyMapping = {
    'Q': 'C',
    'W': 'D',
    'E': 'E',
    'R': 'F',
    'T': 'G',
    'Y': 'A',
    'U': 'B',
    'I': 'C2',
    'O': 'D2',
    'P': 'E2',
  };

  const keyPressed = event.key.toUpperCase();
  const note = keyMapping[keyPressed];

  if (note) {
    // Code to play the corresponding note
    console.log(`Note played: ${note}`);
  }
}
```

This example uses the `keydown` event to trigger the `playNote` function, which maps the keyboard keys to piano notes.
